A PHP class for HTML forms generation and validation. 
It provides an easy and intuitive way of handling both HTML form design (based on templates) and
basic server-side form validation. Custom validation (both server-side and client-side) can also
be implemented very easily. It provides all the basic controls available in an HTML form like
text controls, textarea controls, submit buttons, reset buttons, standard buttons, drop down boxes,
radio buttons, checkboxes, image controls, hidden controls, file upload controls, password controls
and a date picker control.

In order for the date control to work you must also download the PHP Date Picker Class from this
address http://stefangabos.blogspot.com/2006/05/zebra-php-framework-downloads.html and configure
the PHP Form Generation and Validation Class by setting the datePickerPath property to point to
the date picker class
